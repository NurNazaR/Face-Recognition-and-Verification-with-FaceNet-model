#  Face Recognition and Verification with FaceNet model

This repository provides demonstration of how to build accurate face recognition system using the state-of-the-art FaceNet model. The system is deployed in Kivy and do following:
- Face detection: detect and localize faces in the given image using MTCNN 
- Face verification: task that involves verifying the identity of a person with a given image. Is this the same person?
- Face recognition: task that involves recognizing the identity of a person from a database of known faces. Who is this person?
- One-shot-Learning: Machine learning approach where a model is trained to recognize or classify objects based on a single or very few examples per class
